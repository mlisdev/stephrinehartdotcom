                     After working with community colleges for years, I decided I wanted to get my
                     Master's Degree and explore a second career. I earned my MLIS in 2018 and it's the
                     single thing I'm most proud of in this world.

                     <br />
                     I have worked in jobs focused on partnership management, relationship building, and
                     customer success.

                     I believe front end web design should be ADA accessible, crisp, and clear.<br />
                     Back end web development should be secure, easy to navigate, and designed to improve
                     the user experience.
